## **Cooking recipies:**

Butter: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.
Eggs: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.
Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.
Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.
Water: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.
Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.
Flour: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.
Chocolate chips: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.
Nuts (optional): Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch.
